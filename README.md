# FreeCodeCamp Twitch.tv API Project
My attempt at the Twitch.tv API project in FreeCodeCamp's front-end intermediate projects. See it live at https://thedeany.github.io/twitch/.

## Notes
* Uses [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com) for basic styles
* Mobile-friendly
* ES6 Promises

## What I would like to improve
* There's a lot of duplicate code when creating all of the elements
  * Possibly move to React so I'm not manually building the elements
* Improve design
* Add ability to show only live or only offline channels
* Add ability to search for a new user (not one of the default users when the site loads)
